      <description>Shubenacadie River, from Maitland to Green Creek Flooding:
First paddle of the season. There was no ice in the river, still a lot of fresh water due to the melting snow. The strait still has ice, from the bridge you could see almost a 3rd covered.
It wasn&amp;rsquo;t the biggest flow and there was no bore. We did not catch a lot of features and Chris&amp;rsquo;s opinion was that we were too late for most.</description>
